"Make the styling smaller, cleaner, and balanced for a professional company dashboard. Ensure it looks aesthetic, modern, and beautiful with proper box sizing, spacing, and proportions."
1. Add a CSS reset or normalize to remove browser-specific default styles.
2. Use box-sizing: border-box everywhere for consistent sizing.
3. Define global font, line-height, and smoothing for consistency.
4. Make spacing, padding, and margins uniform across browsers.
5. Ensure the design looks visually identical in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.
